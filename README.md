My name is Pradeep (he/him). I'm a self-taught front-end developer who is passionate about learning new technologies & building things.

I'm an art and design enthusiast, so I truly love bringing ideas to life in the form of beautiful and responsive websites.

I believe we never stop learning, so I work hard to expand my skill set and stay updated. With a background in the education field, helping institutes to create an optimal user experience for their e-learning courses, I'm also very familiar with the importance of accessibility.
